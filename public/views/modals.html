                            Percy loves the boss bass line in the chorale setting of The First Noel 
                            and finds himself wandering around during the holidays humming it. It's 
                            melodic and light hearted, something not always associated with bass lines 
                            and a lot of people probably hear this version without even thinking that 
                            they are not hearing the melody because the bass part is so melodic. At 
                            least that's what Percy hopes for.

                            Percy always wondered why his parents were so eager to put him 
                            to bed during the holidays because Santa Claus was only going 
                            to come on one night, Christmas Eve. Percy could fake sleep 
                            like a sloth and has distinct memories of his parents coming 
                            into his room to check up on him while he was wide awake, faking 
                            it. Strangely enough, many years later this is a sweet memory of 
                            Percy's, knowing that his parents loved him and watched over him, 
                            even as he was performing the most boring and simple role.

                            Frosty the dragon was a jolly happy soul
                            <br>
                            He was made of strings and skiing wax and two eyes that glowed like coals

                            And the children say he could laugh and play, just the same as you and me

                            And when they placed it on his head he began to melt on down

                            The song Puff the Magic Dragon troubled Percy deeply. What 
                            sort of boy would betray his best friend, and a dragon no 
                            less. Percy knew that poor Puff had no way to understand 
                            his rejection and Percy worried about the fatility of losing 
                            one's best friend. He remembers crying over it once or twice 
                            alone at night. Frosty the Snowman had a similar story, but 
                            Percy had first hand experience with snow people and knew they 
                            were just stacks of big snowballs made with wet sticky snow 
                            that had no love for anything. Frosty the Dragon is Percy's 
                            way of helping other children deal with Puff-like stories by 
                            substituting a totally worthless snow person for a beautiful 
                            and proud magical creature. 

                            <br><hr><br>

                            Childhood is confusing enough without songs about mythical features 
                            disappearing under emotional duress. When Percy was a young boy the song 
                            Puff the Magic Dragon troubled him deeply because he couldn't understand 
                            why any kid would be stupid enough to reject a freaking dragon, especially 
                            one that was such a great friend. It was inconceivable that a kid could be 
                            so foolishly disloyal to a Dragon. It probably had no way to understand why 
                            it was being rejected by it's best friend and Percy worried that Jackie Paper 
                            actually killed Puff. It was way too much for Percy to bear and he cried over 
                            it once or twice alone at night, but that was enough.
                            <br><br>
                            Frosty the Snowman was a similar sort of thing, but Percy had real first hand 
                            experience with snow people and knew they were just stacked big snowballs that 
                            could only be made when the snow was sticky wet. Making a snowman was usually a 
                            lot of fun unless adults wanted to enforce whatever rules and got mad when you 
                            threw a snowball, perfectly, into the bridge of their nose. Snowmen were pawn-like 
                            soldiers in the wars between siblings and neighborhood packs and never lasted very 
                            long. Percy instinctively understood that the whole song and story of Frosty was a 
                            fabrication by adults that didn't know what a snowman's purpose actually was.
                            <br><br> 
                            In Frosty the Dragon, Percy was probably trying to exorcise his feelings for Puff 
                            by substituting the totally worthless Frosty for him. It does not bother Percy in 
                            the least that he has known several real snowmen and participated in their cruel 
                            demise while he has never seen a reptile larger than a crocodile, which was enough. 
                        </p>

                            Percy's first childhood pet was Dashnika Von Fritzel, a 
                            shorthair dachshund and renowned omnivore. There was something 
                            about having a pet of German origin that led Percy to study 
                            German, that and the fact that his middle school dropped Latin. 
                            Percy loves saying certain German words, like Tannenbaum and 
                            singing German carols, like Franz Gruber's lovely and immortal 
                            Silent Night

                            One of Percy's earliest memories is being scared witless by a 
                            fiberglass-headed Mickey Mouse at Disneyland. Later, the violent 
                            Watts riots frightened him as he watched it described on network 
                            news reports on grainy black and white TV. He became transfixed 
                            by the La Brea Tar Pits where saber tooth cats, sloths, wolves 
                            and mammoths were killed and swallowed whole by black ooze seeping 
                            up from underground. He naturally believes that noir is a dark and 
                            foreboding supernatural force that oozes from a black hole in a 
                            dark corner of the universe and emerges from a portal along the 
                            Pacific Ocean, known to us as the City of Angels.
